\chapter{Introduction}
Energy efficiency is very important in embedded systems development. Often, the microcontroller and its peripherals are battery-powered, or are similarly constrained. For this reason, one has to be careful when implementing programs for such microcontrollers. 

Our goal is to implement a program for the Cortex-M3 microcontroller on the EFM32GG-DK3750 development board that interfaces with an external gamepad using GPIO, and improving the energy efficiency of this implementation as much as possible. The gamepad has eight buttons and eight LED lights, and the implementation should make button presses light up the LEDs in some way.
