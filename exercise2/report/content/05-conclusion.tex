\chapter{Conclusion}
%This chapter should be a look back at the entire report and summarizing the problem, the solution and the obtained results.

We have learned a lot about the EFM32GG and its hardware and how to program it. In the beginning we didn't know how to produce sound or do anything advanced with the board, but through testing and failing, the EFM32GG manual\cite{efm32ggrm} and the compendium\cite{compendium} we managed to solve the problem we were presented. We had a slow start in the beginning, but once a few obstacles were overcome, everything quickly got put together and we achieved our goal.

Our task was to create a system that could play different sounds when a peripheral was interacted with. With our solution you can play many different sounds and songs by pressing different buttons on the gamepad.
