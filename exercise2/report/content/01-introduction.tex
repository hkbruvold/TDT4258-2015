\chapter{Introduction}
Our main objective in this exercise will be to use the EFM32GG development board to produce sound. After the exercise we should know how development for embedded systems differs from traditional computers. For this exercise we will be coding in C instead of assembly, and we will be familiarizing ourselves with the microcontroller and its peripherals and the focus on energy conservation of the EFM32GG development board. 
\\
\\
In this exercise we write a program in C that enables the user to play sounds and songs by pressing the different buttons on the gamepad peripheral. 

% -introduction: a good start, but could use more content. anything that relates to the problem or field in general could go here: why are microprocessros/embedded systems important, why low-level programming etc. you can also give a more concrete description of your own solution (i.e. how the button presses map to the LEDs)
