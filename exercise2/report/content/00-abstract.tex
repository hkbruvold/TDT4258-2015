This document will provide you with the information about how we solved our second exercise in TDT 4258 - Low-Level Programming. We will write about the theoretical background need to solve the problem. We will talk about the hardware, its peripherals, software, and techniques which we use to create an energy efficient program. \\Our main goal was to create a system that plays a multitude of sound and combinations of them (e.g. songs) on different button presses, while keeping it energy efficient. Without the use of an operating system we created a solution for the exercise that can play sounds and songs. By using energy efficient techniques and methods we managed to achieve an idle power consumption 8 times lower than without.
