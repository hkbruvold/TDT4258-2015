For the third exercise in TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Design, we implement a Linux character device driver and a simple game for the EFM32GG-DK3750 development board. The specific flavor of Linux used is uClinux. We implement a clone of the classic DOS game ``Cervii'' from 1993, using the integrated LCD screen for output, and a GPIO gamepad for input. The device driver is used to interface with the gamepad over GPIO.

By making use of concepts such as interrupts and signals, as well as certain Linux kernel configurations, we managed to reduce the energy usage of the running game by about 15\%.
