\chapter{Conclusion}
In this assignment we started with making the device driver for the gamepads buttons and figuring out how to draw on the screen, before we starting to implement the core game. 
We successfully implemented the game we intended to based on the original. We learned about making device drivers for Linux, char drivers, the linux framebuffer and the process behind implementing Linux on the development board (toolchain, ptxdist, etc).
\\
Not many issues were encountered except for normal development bumps. Some faulty documentation and guides hampered our progress, but most were fixed by trial and error to get it working. 
\\
The final product is a playable game for two players (or one if you're handy).

Only 4 of the 8 buttons are used for controlling the game, so it may have been possible to make it 4 player by utilizing all 8 buttons for playing instead.
